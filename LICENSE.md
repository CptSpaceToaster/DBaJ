This code is ©2014 jakimfett ("the author") all rights reserved, and is licensed for use and redistribution under the “Don’t Be a Jerk” non-commercial care-free license.

This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the mod, including but not limited to:
* Download code or mod for personal use
* Put the mod into your modpack
* Fork the repository on github
* Compile the code
* Modify the code to: 
  * fix bugs 
  * add features 
  * fit better with your modpack
  * remove a problematic item
* Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation
* Record portions of gameplay for display on YouTube or other video/media sites

The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code.

This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the mod is yours without permission from the previous author(s).

You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, or anything having to do with the mod or mod code. 

This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

Specific exceptions may be made if, for example, you make a cool tee-shirt design based off the mod and want to sell that, or are using the mod as part of a charity event, or other normal use cases. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the mod author.

This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the mod. Bugs happen, so make backups, and don't complain if your world gets corrupted. Seriously, make backups.

Ultimately, don't be a jerk, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine.

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.
