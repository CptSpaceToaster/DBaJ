The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code. It'd be cool if you'd include a copy of the license with the code, or at least link to it.

This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the mod is yours without permission from the previous author(s). 

You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc etc.

This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the mod. Bugs happen, so make backups, and don't complain if your world gets corrupted. Seriously, make backups.

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.
